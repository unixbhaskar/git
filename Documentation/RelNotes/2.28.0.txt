Git 2.28 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.27
-------------------

Backward compatibility notes

 * "feature.experimental" configuration variable is to let volunteers
   easily opt into a set of newer features, which use of the v2
   transport protocol is now a part of.


UI, Workflows & Features

 * The commands in the "diff" family learned to honor "diff.relative"
   configuration variable.



Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Code optimization for a common case.
   (merge 8777616e4d an/merge-single-strategy-optim later to maint).

 * We've adopted a convention that any on-stack structure can be
   initialized to have zero values in all fields with "= { 0 }",
   even when the first field happens to be a pointer, but sparse
   complained that a null pointer should be spelled NULL for a long
   time.  Start using -Wno-universal-initializer option to squelch
   it (the latest sparse has it on by default).



Fixes since v2.27
-----------------

 * The "--prepare-p4-only" option of "git p4" is supposed to stop
   after replaying one changeset, but kept going (by mistake?)

 * The error message from "git checkout -b foo -t bar baz" was
   confusing.

 * Some repositories in the wild have commits that record nonsense
   committer timezone (e.g. rails.git); "git fast-import" learned an
   option to pass these nonsense timestamps intact to allow recreating
   existing repositories as-is.
   (merge d42a2fb72f en/fast-import-looser-date later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 2c31a7aa44 jx/pkt-line-doc-count-fix later to maint).
   (merge d63ae31962 cb/t5608-cleanup later to maint).
