Git 2.30 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.29
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Userdiff for PHP update.

 * Userdiff for Rust update.

 * Userdiff for CSS update.

 * The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned that "git
   stash show" takes the options "git diff" takes.

 * "git worktree list" now shows if each worktree is locked.  This
   possibly may open us to show other kinds of states in the future.

 * "git maintenance", an extended big brother of "git gc", continues
   to evolve.

 * "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
   commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
   A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
   being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
   tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.

 * "git clone" learned clone.defaultremotename configuration variable
   to customize what nickname to use to call the remote the repository
   was cloned from.

 * "git checkout" learned to use checkout.guess configuration variable
   and enable/disable its "--[no-]guess" option accordingly.

 * "git resurrect" script (in contrib/) learned that the object names
   may be longer than 40-hex depending on the hash function in use.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Use "git archive" more to produce the release tarball.

 * GitHub Actions automated test improvement to skip tests on a tree
   identical to what has already been tested.


Fixes since v2.29
-----------------

 * In 2.29, "--committer-date-is-author-date" option of "rebase" and
   "am" subcommands lost the e-mail address by mistake, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 5f35edd9d7 jk/committer-date-is-author-date-fix later to maint).

 * "git checkout -p A...B [-- <path>]" did not work, even though the
   same command without "-p" correctly used the merge-base between
   commits A and B.
   (merge 35166b1fb5 dl/checkout-p-merge-base later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 3e0a5dc9af cc/doc-filter-branch-typofix later to maint).
   (merge 32c83afc2c cw/ci-ghwf-check-ws-errors later to maint).
   (merge 5eb2ed691b rs/tighten-callers-of-deref-tag later to maint).
