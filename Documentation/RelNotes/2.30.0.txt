Git 2.30 Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.29
-------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Userdiff for PHP update.

 * Userdiff for Rust update.

 * Userdiff for CSS update.

 * The command line completion script (in contrib/) learned that "git
   stash show" takes the options "git diff" takes.

 * "git worktree list" now shows if each worktree is locked.  This
   possibly may open us to show other kinds of states in the future.

 * "git maintenance", an extended big brother of "git gc", continues
   to evolve.

 * "git push --force-with-lease[=<ref>]" can easily be misused to lose
   commits unless the user takes good care of their own "git fetch".
   A new option "--force-if-includes" attempts to ensure that what is
   being force-pushed was created after examining the commit at the
   tip of the remote ref that is about to be force-replaced.

 * "git clone" learned clone.defaultremotename configuration variable
   to customize what nickname to use to call the remote the repository
   was cloned from.

 * "git checkout" learned to use checkout.guess configuration variable
   and enable/disable its "--[no-]guess" option accordingly.

 * "git resurrect" script (in contrib/) learned that the object names
   may be longer than 40-hex depending on the hash function in use.

 * "git diff A...B" learned "git diff --merge-base A B", which is a
   longer short-hand to say the same thing.

 * A sample 'push-to-checkout' hook, that performs the same as
   what the built-in default action does, has been added.

 * "git diff" family of commands learned the "-I<regex>" option to
   ignore hunks whose changed lines all match the given pattern.

 * The userdiff pattern learned to identify the function definition in
   POSIX shells and bash.

 * "git checkout-index" did not consistently signal an error with its
   exit status, but now it does.

 * A commit and tag object may have CR at the end of each and
   every line (you can create such an object with hash-object or
   using --cleanup=verbatim to decline the default clean-up
   action), but it would make it impossible to have a blank line
   to separate the title from the body of the message.  We are now
   more lenient and accept a line with lone CR on it as a blank line,
   too.

 * Exit codes from "git remote add" etc. were not usable by scripted
   callers, but now they are.

 * Zsh autocompletion (in contrib/) update.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Use "git archive" more to produce the release tarball.

 * GitHub Actions automated test improvement to skip tests on a tree
   identical to what has already been tested.

 * Test-coverage for running commit-graph task "git maintenance" has
   been extended.

 * Our test scripts can be told to run only individual pieces while
   skipping others with the "--run=..." option; they were taught to
   take a substring of test title, in addition to numbers, to name the
   test pieces to run.

 * Adjust tests so that they won't scream when the default initial
   branch name is changed to 'main'.

 * Rewriting "git bisect" in C continues.

 * More preliminary tests have been added to document desired outcome
   of various "directory rename" situations.

 * Micro clean-up of a couple of test scripts.

 * "git diff" and other commands that share the same machinery to
   compare with working tree files have been taught to take advantage
   of the fsmonitor data when available.

 * The code to detect premature EOF in the sideband demultiplexer has
   been cleaned up.

 * Test scripts are being prepared to transition of the default branch
   name to 'main'.



Fixes since v2.29
-----------------

 * In 2.29, "--committer-date-is-author-date" option of "rebase" and
   "am" subcommands lost the e-mail address by mistake, which has been
   corrected.
   (merge 5f35edd9d7 jk/committer-date-is-author-date-fix later to maint).

 * "git checkout -p A...B [-- <path>]" did not work, even though the
   same command without "-p" correctly used the merge-base between
   commits A and B.
   (merge 35166b1fb5 dl/checkout-p-merge-base later to maint).

 * The side-band status report can be sent at the same time as the
   primary payload multiplexed, but the demultiplexer on the receiving
   end incorrectly split a single status report into two, which has
   been corrected.
   (merge 712b0377db js/avoid-split-sideband-message later to maint).

 * "git fast-import" wasted a lot of memory when many marks were in use.
   (merge 3f018ec716 jk/fast-import-marks-alloc-fix later to maint).

 * A test helper "test_cmp A B" was taught to diagnose missing files A
   or B as a bug in test, but some tests legitimately wanted to notice
   a failure to even create file B as an error, in addition to leaving
   the expected result in it, and were misdiagnosed as a bug.  This
   has been corrected.
   (merge 262d5ad5a5 es/test-cmp-typocatcher later to maint).

 * When "git commit-graph" detects the same commit recorded more than
   once while it is merging the layers, it used to die.  The code now
   ignores all but one of them and continues.
   (merge 85102ac71b ds/commit-graph-merging-fix later to maint).

 * The meaning of a Signed-off-by trailer can vary from project to
   project; this and also what it means to this project has been
   clarified in the documentation.
   (merge 3abd4a67d9 bk/sob-dco later to maint).

 * "git credential' didn't honor the core.askPass configuration
   variable (among other things), which has been corrected.
   (merge 567ad2c0f9 tk/credential-config later to maint).

 * Dev support to catch a tentative definition of a variable in our C
   code as an error.
   (merge 5539183622 jk/no-common later to maint).

 * "git rebase --rebase-merges" did not correctly pass --gpg-sign
   command line option to underlying "git merge" when replaying a merge
   using non-default merge strategy or when replaying an octopus merge
   (because replaying a two-head merge with the default strategy was
   done in a separate codepath, the problem did not trigger for most
   users), which has been corrected.
   (merge 43ad4f2eca sc/sequencer-gpg-octopus later to maint).

 * "git apply -R" did not handle patches that touch the same path
   twice correctly, which has been corrected.  This is most relevant
   in a patch that changes a path from a regular file to a symbolic
   link (and vice versa).
   (merge b0f266de11 jt/apply-reverse-twice later to maint).

 * A recent oid->hash conversion missed one spot, breaking "git svn".
   (merge 03bb366de4 bc/svn-hash-oid-fix later to maint).

 * Other code cleanup, docfix, build fix, etc.
   (merge 3e0a5dc9af cc/doc-filter-branch-typofix later to maint).
   (merge 32c83afc2c cw/ci-ghwf-check-ws-errors later to maint).
   (merge 5eb2ed691b rs/tighten-callers-of-deref-tag later to maint).
   (merge 6db29ab213 jk/fast-import-marks-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge e5cf6d3df4 nk/dir-c-comment-update later to maint).
   (merge 5710dcce74 jk/report-fn-typedef later to maint).
   (merge 9a82db1056 en/sequencer-rollback-lock-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge 4e1bee9a99 js/t7006-cleanup later to maint).
   (merge f5bcde6c58 es/tutorial-mention-asciidoc-early later to maint).
